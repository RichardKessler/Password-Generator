Once you load the site you will se a text area where the generated password will appear.  You will see a button that says "Generate Password".  Click that button and you will be asked to input how long you wan the password to be (strength) with a minimum of 8 characters and max of 128.  After the strength has be entered a series of prompts will ask if you want to include lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special character symbols (ie. ! @ # % $).
